# Your Field Guide to Landing Your First Job!

Finding your first co-op, internship or New Grad role is brutal in today's job market. There's no magic wand to fix this issue, but as a 2nd generation Canadian who managed to break into the corporate world, I wanted to create resources to help students navigate this really hard transition time.

As a means to help students, I've started donating time each Sunday to provide free career coaching on [ADPList](https://adplist.org/mentors/canny-chiu). However, I realized that 1:1s is not the most sustainable so I wanted to dedicate time on building a self-serve, async resource hub for students to leverage.

<h1>[WIP]1. But what is networking really? </h1>

I am sure that this answer comes up a lot, but I do believe that students who make an effort to network while in school set themselves up for success. Networking is an opportunity to learn more about the industry, learn of new job opportunities (before they are posted) and get insights from employers on how to stand out as a candidate. It should be noted that networking needs to be authentic and should be long-term focused. You should be connecting with people in order to build genuine relationships based on shared professional interests & values rather than the sake of securing a summer job. Networking doesn’t always have to be a stuffy career fair. As an introvert, I much preferred coffee chats. Not sure where to find people to connect with? Check out: Ten Thousand Coffees.
<h1>2.[WIP] Discovering Jobs</h1>

* Campus Career Centres
* Getting involved with non-profit organizations that gear towards industries
* Slack channels
* Boolean strings targetting ATS systems

* Handshake
<h1>3.[WIP[]    Showcasing “you” </h1>
* Courses/Academic Background - show us what you're learning
* Relevant Hobbies/Interests

* Campus extra-curriculars, specifically leadership roles
<h1>4. [WIP]   Be a life-long learner</h1>
With the growth of e-learning, education does not necessarily have to happen inside the four walls of a classroom. With the availability of e-learning tools such as Lynda.com (powered by LinkedIn), you are able to build your own personal curriculum made up of courses in Technology, Business & Creative Skills. Fun fact: Toronto Public Library provides a free subscription to Lynda.com. Many schools also offer subscriptions as well so definitely do your research! Each course is video based and allows learners to move at their own pace as well. As a student, you can really build up your technical skills to prepare you for future work terms & impress your employers! From my own experience, Excel & Outlook Fundamentals are a great start to your learning journey.
<h1>5. [WIP]   Interview the company </h1>
I firmly believe the best candidate is the best person for the role and the best person for the company. The strongest candidate may not get the job if they have not taken the time to learn about the company including its values & products. For students interviewing for summer internships, I strongly suggest taking the time to research the company you are interviewing for. 
Some potential sources of information include: 
* Glassdoor, 
* LinkedIn, 
* Employees and Corporate Social Responsibility Reports
* The Recruiter
* All of the Interviewers 

Using your own intuition and critical thinking, determine if the company meets your needs, whether it be culture, values, work-life balance or career opportunities.

**Be kind to yourself**

Last, but not least, be kind to yourself. The job search process is not easy and may be filled with rejections! I know that I received rejections well into the double digits while looking for internships & full-time work. Don’t take it personally and use your rejections as motivation to improve your applications and interviews! 

I hope this github rep helps you with your job search and that when it comes to that time in your career where you can give back, you choose to do so also :)
