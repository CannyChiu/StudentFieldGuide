# Your Field Guide to Landing Your First Job!

Finding your first co-op, internship or New Grad role is brutal in today's job market. There's no magic wand to fix this issue, but as a 2nd generation Canadian who managed to break into the corporate world, I wanted to create resources to help students navigate this really hard transition time.

As a means to help students, I've started donating time each Sunday to provide free career coaching on [ADPList](https://adplist.org/mentors/canny-chiu). However, I realized that 1:1s is not the most sustainable so I wanted to dedicate time on building a self-serve, async resource hub for students to leverage.

<h1>[WIP]1. But what is networking really? </h1>

I am sure that this answer comes up a lot, but I do believe that students who make an effort to network while in school set themselves up for success. Networking is an opportunity to learn more about the industry, learn of new job opportunities (before they are posted) and get insights from employers on how to stand out as a candidate. It should be noted that networking needs to be authentic and should be long-term focused. You should be connecting with people in order to build genuine relationships based on shared professional interests & values rather than the sake of securing a summer job.

I find that when I tell students to "network", they automatically assume it's going to a stuffy career fair with thousands of people. There's nothing wrong with this approach either, but as an introvert, I actually much prefer 1:1 conversations more than anything. If you're looking to find 1:1 coffee opportunities, some organizations to check out:
* Your local university or college's alumni program.
* Reaching out to speakers at your local community tech event or [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/). If you're in Tech, I compiled a list of meet-ups [here](https://github.com/CannyChiu/TalentPartnerHub/wiki/Technology-Talent-Communities-(Job-Boards,-Slack-Channels,-Diversity-Organizations,-Meet-ups,-etc)) if you want to check it out! 
* Sites like [Ten Thousand Coffees](https://www.tenthousandcoffees.com/) or [ADPlist](https://adplist.org/) where you can get matched with professionals in the career path you're interested in

<h1>3.[WIP]    Showcasing “you” </h1>
As a recruiter, we see hundreds, if not thousands of resumes per day. The reality is that you need to differentiate yourself from your competition. Listing your tech stack is the bare minimum in my opinion. 
We also understand that as students, you won't have 3-5 years of experience. When I've worked with Hiring Managers, a stand-out student has always been someone that has shown they are hungry to learn, have shown leadership in their life outsife of school and genuine passion for the company & the role. 

**Things that have interested me about a person's profile:**
* Courses/Academic Background - show us what you're learning. If it's unconventional and intentional - I love that, it shows me you have intellectual curiosity.
* Hobbies/Interests - I've always found that if someone is able to channel their passion into continuous learning (even if it has NOTHING to do with their career), it's a huge signal of discipline and self-motivation. I see it as a sign of their growth potential in their career.
* Side projects on Github, Kaggle, Behance - having random projects you work on shows me that you're interested in your field outside of the direct pay check. I'm not expecting someone to be commiting code every night on personal projects while raising a family! I think having side projects is a nice optional thing that can show recruiters that you enjoy the craft (career) you've chosen. I think it's also important to state that if you genuinely are fulfilled in your day-to-day responsbilities (don't get me wrong, being paid is super important to), you have a higher chance of sustaining yourself in the marathon known as a career.
* Campus extra-curriculars, specifically leadership roles - Getting involved on campus is a huge plus for students, you get to: meet new friends, build new soft skills (project management, time management, public speaking, and more), networking, and much much more. Outside of the benefits to you as a student, as an employer, I love seeing what students are passionate about and it is a signal that you're the type to take initiative and fix those "broken windows". 

<h1>4. [WIP]   Be a life-long learner</h1>
With the growth of e-learning, education does not necessarily have to happen inside the four walls of a classroom. With the availability of e-learning tools such as Lynda.com (powered by LinkedIn), you are able to build your own personal curriculum made up of courses in Technology, Business & Creative Skills. Fun fact: Toronto Public Library provides a free subscription to Lynda.com. Many schools also offer subscriptions as well so definitely do your research! Each course is video based and allows learners to move at their own pace as well. As a student, you can really build up your technical skills to prepare you for future work terms & impress your employers! From my own experience, Excel & Outlook Fundamentals are a great start to your learning journey.

<h1>5. [WIP]   Interview the company </h1>
I firmly believe the best candidate is the best person for the role and the best person for the company. The strongest candidate may not get the job if they have not taken the time to learn about the company including its values & products. For students interviewing for summer internships, I strongly suggest taking the time to research the company you are interviewing for. 

**Some potential sources of information include:**
* Career Focused Websites (Glassdoor, etc) 
* Social Media Websites (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn)
* Corporate Social Responsibility Reports
* Company Financial Statements or Quarterly Earning Reports
* The Recruiter
* The Hiring Manager
* Other Interviewers

<h1>6. [WIP]   Interviewing best practices </h1>
* Excellent article from Handshake on the types of interviews you might encounter in the professional world: https://joinhandshake.com/blog/students/types-of-interviews/
* The most common type of interviews are STARR interviews (Situation, Task, Action, Results, Relate). Knowing how to communicate in this format will do wonders for your job search. My secret hack to mastering STARR interviews is to create your own bank of examples for various competencies you've demonstrated. IE. If you know detail-orientated is required in the jobs that you apply for, you should take the time to write out 2-3 examples of times where you showed detail-orientation. The intent is not to memorize the example verbatim, BUT, it allows you to automatically jog up the example and be able to authentically and clearly communicate an example. The worst thing is when you know you've showed the skill before, but your mind just runs "blank" due to the pressures of a live interview.
* I always advise candidates to review the skills, competencies & qualifications section of a job posting before an interview. Imagine that section of the posting as the thesis and your answers as the paragraphs in your essay. You need to consciously link back to the thesis in the conversation.

**Be kind to yourself**

Last, but not least, be kind to yourself. The job search process is not easy and may be filled with rejections! I know that I received rejections well into the double digits while looking for internships & full-time work. Don’t take it personally and use your rejections as motivation to improve your applications and interviews! 

I hope this github rep helps you with your job search and that when it comes to that time in your career where you can give back, you choose to do so also :)
